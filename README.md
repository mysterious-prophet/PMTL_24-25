## Class Completion
Classified credit assignment (grades A–E)

- Turn in four programs by the end of the semester (mid February). If you turn a program in before the classes end in December (in person), you can just show it to me and get a feedback and a grade. The final grade will be the average of these four grades. Programs turned in after classes end will have to come with a short documentation (preferably in Latex) containing problem formulation, function inputs and outputs, results obtained, ...
  
- There will be (probably) 6 general topics
	- The first 2 topics (function, plot) will be compulsory
	- There will be additional 3 or 4 topics - to pass the class you can choose any 2 of these

- Current topic proposals (with some examples, just to give you the idea of the expected difficulty)
	- Compulsory
		1. Simple function
			- Matlab function with inputs and outputs
			- Examples: Fibonacci sequence generator, quadratic equation solver, temperature converter, prime number finder, Horner's scheme, prime factorization; mean, median, mode, variance, etc. calculator, various norms (Euclidean, etc.), ...
 
		2. Visual representation of results, i.e. plots (2D or 3D)
 			- Matlab program that generates several plots of the results
			- Examples: Wave functions, Bar charts/Histograms, Scatter plots, 3D surface plots, animated plots - analog clock, Lorentz attractor, regression fit plot, contour plots, fractals, ...
      
	- Advanced, choose any 2 of these
   
 		3. "Interesting" algorithm
			- Choose an interesting algorithm and implement it
			- Examples: Conway's Game of Life, Sorting algorithms, Newton-Raphson Method, K-Means Clustering, Brownian Motion, Signal analysis with FFT, A* algorithm, LU Decomposition, Sobel Filter, Dijkstra's Algorithm, PCA, ...
   
		4. Stochastic simulation
			- Program involving randomness of some kind
			- Examples: Monte Carlo (pi finding, integrals), Random walks, Markov chains, randomized quicksort, maze generator and solver, radioactive decay, number guessing game, dice rolling histogram, random melody generator, ...
     
		6. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?
			- Create a program that uses the Object Oriented Programming paradigm - classes, structures, inheritance, etc.
			- Examples: shape classes, vehicle classes, shop simulator - inventory management, health and fitness tracker, particle simulator, zoo manager, RPG game class system, chess game, ...
     
 		8. App with GUI
			- Program implementing graphical interface
			- Examples: calculator, plotting tool, unit conversion tool, tic-tac-toe, sudoku solver, BMI calculator, maze generator and solver, ...

- **It is strongly preferred if you come up with your own ideas** that fit the general topics above. These can be your own results from other classes, your own research, or just the stuff that interest you. If you can come up with a program from the advanced topics that naturally combines two or more of them, the program can also be counted as two or more. Such program should be of a length and complexity corresponding to the number of topics it covers.
